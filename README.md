# Zomblinks
 
 Setup:
 1. Arrange Blinks into a play area. Multiple pathways to simulate streets & alleys is recommended, but almost any arrangement will do.
 2. Long-press any Blink to cycle between player (cyan at full health), spawner (orange while inactive, grey while active), and empty states.
 3. Single-click a spawner to toggle between inactive and active.
 4. Active spawners will occasionally spawn zombies (green), which will wander around until they "smell" a player.

 Players:
 - Single-click an adjacent empty Blink to move there.
 - Double-click an adjacent empty Blink to fire a bullet in that direction. You (currently) have unlimited ammo.
 - Double-click an adjacent Zombie or spawner to melee for double damage.

 Note: Players can't move or fire adjacent to other players. You can, however, damage other players with bullets, so be careful!

 Zombies:
 - Take 3 hits to kill.
 - More likely to move toward players when they're close.

 Spawners:
 - Can be destroyed, but regenerate slowly while active.
 - Use them in inactive mode as destructible barriers.
